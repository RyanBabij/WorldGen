# WorldGen
World Generator


### Sample Output

One of the PNGs generated by the algorithm. Normally the PNG is uncompressed to make the generator run faster. Each pixel has a colour which represents a biome. For example the blue is ocean, the dark green is jungle, etc. The colours can represent anything really. The PNG is just for viewing purposes, so you can see if you have created a nice map. The program also outputs a text file which contains the world data.
