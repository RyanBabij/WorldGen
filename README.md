# WorldGen
Program for creating a random world map. The map can then be imported into another program and used for a game. Each pixel is a tile. For some games you can generate a local map for each tile. Each tile is given a seed for this purpose.

### Sample Output

One of the PNGs generated by the algorithm. Normally the PNG is uncompressed to make the generator run faster. Each pixel has a colour which represents a biome. For example the blue is ocean, the dark green is jungle, etc. The colours can represent anything really. The PNG is just for viewing purposes, so you can see if you have created a nice map. The program also outputs a text file which contains the world data.
